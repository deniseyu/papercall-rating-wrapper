## A thin app that imports Papercall talk submission JSON data and enables:

* Off-platform manual redaction for submission content fields
* Assigning proposals to certain reviewers
* Hide previous ratings on a proposal
* Rating aggregation to build stack-ranked list
* Persisting review committee-only notes

Data cannot be re-imported into Papercall. Unfortunately someone has to manually
copy submission status back in :-(
